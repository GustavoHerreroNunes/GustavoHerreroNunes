### Hello you!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜€

>You can read the Portuguese version (pt-br) of my README by [Clicking here][portuguese].

My name is Gustavo Herrero Nunes, I am Brazilian and currently I am student of System Development, in a Technical course integrated to high school, at Etec Zona Leste (_SÃ£o Paulo - SP_).
Although I am new in the IT field, I am really enjoying it, and I believe I have found my vocation, my passion :computer::heart:.

Nowadays I am studying and developing Java, Javascript, Html5, Css3, PHP e Arduino.
