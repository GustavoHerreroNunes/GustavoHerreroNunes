### Hello you!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜€

>You can read the Portuguese version (pt-br) of my README by [Clicking here][portuguese].

My name is Gustavo Herrero Nunes, I am Brazilian and I am a System Development Technician, graduated in 2021 from Etec Zona Leste (_SÃ£o Paulo - SP_), and currently I am open to work.
Although I am new in the IT field, I am really enjoying it, and I believe I have found my vocation, my passion :computer::heart:.

Nowadays I am studying and developing Html5, Css3, Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap and Cordova.
